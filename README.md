# Churn_Modelling
In this project I've used Artificial Neural Network to predict whether customer of a bank would continue their association with the bank or not. I've used numpy for mathematical computations and for the data pre-processing. The main model has been built on tensorflow. The model was trained on 200 epochs with batch size of 32.
